# Part 3 of Bio and Neural Rights: Keep Humanity Alive

*Part 3 of a 3-part series on bio/neural modification and protecting humanity: The 3 Simple Things You Can Do Today to Keep Humanity Alive*

**TL;DR: We need laws to protect people from bio and neural modifications. Help support new legislation.**

Bio and neural modification is advancing without the same level of guardrails being developed or applied to other technologies such as nuclear, cyber, or AI. But individuals—not just scientists or policymakers—can meaningfully influence the future. Here are the three most impactful actions you can take now.

## **1\. Support Neural Rights Legislation**

Policies are emerging, but they need public pressure to pass. Good legislation should:

- Require explicit consent for any neural or biological modification
    
- Ban manipulation of behavior for harm
    
- Protect neural data collected by devices or interfaces
    
- Consider putting limits on genetic engineering and lab-grown brains
    
- Establishing the right to cognitive liberty
    

**How to help:**

- Contact your state representatives
    
- Submit comments on proposed bills
    
- Advocate for new legislation where none exists
    

Chile has already implemented neural rights protections; several U.S. states are exploring similar laws.

## **2\. Raise Awareness**

The biggest vulnerability right now might be lack of awareness. Most people simply might not know these technologies exist.

You can make an impact by:

- Sharing this series
    
- Discussing bio and neural rights in your community
    
- Posting about it on social media
    
- Writing to local news outlets
    
- Bringing it up in work or academic settings
    

Awareness drives policy—and we are far behind.

## **3\. Connect With Organizations Working on These Risks**

You don’t need to work alone. Consider engaging with or supporting:

- **Academic institutions** with relevant research programs, such as bioethics centers and technology policy institutes
    
- **Civil liberties organizations** increasingly engaging with digital and biological rights
    
    - Electronic Frontier Foundation - "The leading nonprofit defending digital privacy, free speech, and innovation."
        - info@eff.org

If you have expertise in science, law, ethics, tech, or policy, your contribution could be especially valuable. Even internal advocacy within your own workplace matters.

## **Why This Matters**

The technology will not pause for us. Safeguards must grow alongside capability. Momentum is building, but we need more voices, more awareness, and more people willing to take simple steps to protect human autonomy.

Every action counts—one conversation, one email, one petition, one shared link.

Let’s ensure neural technology serves humanity rather than controls it.
